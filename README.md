# Real-time collaborative document editor

This is a server and client for a real-time collaborative document editor. The implementation is as described in [this
paper](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00071240/).

This is a toy and is not fully functional yet. I wrote it with node and typescript, neither of which I have experience
with. I don't recommend using any of this as production/example code :)
