# Real-time collaborative document editor

This is a server and client for a real-time collaborative document editor. The implementation is as described in (this
paper)[https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00071240/].

It's a toy - not at all something that's ready to be deployed. Use it for learning if you want, but not for anything
serious :)
